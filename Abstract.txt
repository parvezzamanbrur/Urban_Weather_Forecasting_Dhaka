Abstract:

Urban weather forecasting is critical for effective planning and decision-making in rapidly growing cities. This study presents a multi-model framework for forecasting urban weather patterns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, focusing on key meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and dew point. Using a combination of traditional statistical models (ARIMA and SARIMA) and advanced machine learning techniques (Prophet, RNN, LSTM, and GRU), this research aims to provide a robust comparative analysis of these models for accurate weather prediction. The study utilizes historical weather data for Dhaka, with coordinates at 23.8° N latitude and 90.42° E longitude, to evaluate the performance of each model in forecasting future weather trends.

ARIMA and SARIMA models, known for their time series analysis capabilities, are compared with the more complex, non-linear models (Prophet, RNN, LSTM, and GRU), which have shown great promise in capturing intricate patterns in weather data. The comparative study focuses on accuracy metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), aiming to identify the most reliable and efficient forecasting approach for urban meteorological applications in Dhaka. This work highlights the strengths and limitations of both statistical and machine learning methods, offering insights into the practical applications of these models in urban weather forecasting. The findings are expected to contribute to better predictive accuracy in weather forecasting and assist in climate adaptation strategies for Dhaka, where urbanization and climate change impact weather patterns.
